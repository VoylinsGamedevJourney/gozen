## What is GoZen 

I named the editor GoZen, **Go** comes from Godot and **Zen** from ... zen. Basically, the name implies that the video editor is made in Godot, and that it should be a _zen_ experience to use it.

（午前）Gozen also means morning in Japanese, so the logo represents a rising sun.

### Goals

I have a list of goals which I would like to achieve with GoZen, as this is a project which will consume many months, maybe even years, it is important that I stick to these initial goals/values to make GoZen into a _world class editor_.

The goals/values of GoZen are:

- **Open source learning experience**, I'll try to do this with videos of it's development and explanations of how I implemented certain features;
- **Free and Open source**, keep this project completely free and open source;
- **Linux first**, as I am a linux user who had been struggling to find a good video which would fit my needs;
- **Useful**, no crashes and provide the flexibility people want;
- **Not too complex**, without losing functionality;
- **Zen experience**, don't stress people who try to use GoZen by providing a _minimalist_ environment;
- **Modular**, I use Godot for multiple reasons, but this also makes it very easy for people to create their own modules for the editor;
- **Compete** with the big video editors.

### Competing with the big guys!

When I say competing with other big video editors, this is something I'm serious about. Each video editor has their own goals which they want to achieve. My goal is to create a minimalist video editor without too many compromises. Through all Godot supported languages (GDScript, C++, C#), it becomes easier for people to create their own modules which can add their required functionalities.

The first milestone, version 1.0.0, should have all functionality to be called a video editor. Maybe a bit unpolished, but it will be in a working condition. Version 1.0.0 will mainly be consisting out of all required features. From this point, version 1.0.0, the main development focus will turn from functionality to the overall feel of the editor so people will actually want to use GoZen for editing their videos with.

It is highly possible that we will first have a working version of the editor for version 0.9.0 and that the UI improvements will make the number slowly go to 1.0.0. Not yet certain about version numbering at this point as it is too early to tell
