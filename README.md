# GoZen

*The Minimalist Video Editor*

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> GoZen is in Alpha at the moment! Beta release is to be expected in late 2025.

## What is GoZen?

GoZen is a minimalistic video editor. Not too many bells and whistles, with the aim at being stable and performant. The main supported OS is Linux as I, Voylin, am a Linux user myself who got too frustrated by the lack of good video editors being available.

I named the editor GoZen, **Go** comes from Godot and **Zen** from ... zen. Basically, the name implies that the video editor is made in Godot, and that it should be a _zen_ experience to use it. （午前）Gozen also means morning in Japanese, so the logo represents a rising sun. I'm quite a morning person and seeing the sunrise always makes me feel like I'll have a productive day, so the meaning of GoZen links to being productive and zen experience.
